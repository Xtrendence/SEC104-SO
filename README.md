## Q&A to explain the goal of this repository.

### What is this repository?

Whenever I have an exam, or something to study for, I usually go through the material and write some revision notes. It helps me memorize things, and I can look over the notes later on without going through a whole book or podcast. Since I know how to make websites, it only made sense to make the notes publicly accessible, and making a GitHub repo seemed like a good idea. That way, not only can I access them from anywhere, but I can share them with anyone that needs or wants them.

### Will you do this for every exam?

Probably, but I can't promise anything.

### The website won't work, what should I do?

Send me a message on a platform of your choosing, all my social media accounts are linked on my [website](https://www.xtrendence.com) at the very bottom.

### Can I share this with whoever I want to?

Yes, I really don't care what you do with this. Just credit me or something.
