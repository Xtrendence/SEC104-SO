				<span class="title">TCP overview</span>
				<span class="description">Point-to-point (one sender, one receiver), reliable (in-order byte stream, so no message boundaries), pipelined (TCP congestion and flow control set window size), full duplex data (bi-directional data flow in same connection, maximum segment size or MSS), connection oriented (handshaking), flow controlled (throttling so the sender doesn’t overwhelm the receiver).</span>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP flags</span>
				<span class="description">FIN (gracefully terminate a connection). SYN (establish a new session). RST (abort a session). PSH (push data). ACK (acknowledge the receipt of data). URG (urgent data being sent).</span>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP sequence numbers</span>
				<span class="description">Byte stream number of first byte in segment’s data, acknowledgment (sequence number of next byte is expected from the other end, cumulative ACK). Initial sequence number is randomly generated, then the next sequence number is the current one added with the segment length.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP connection</span>
				<span class="description">Established with a three-way handshake (client sends server SYN, server sends ACK and SYN, client sends ACK).</span>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP data transfer</span>
				<span class="description">Creates reliable transfer service on top of IP’s unreliable service. Pipelined segments, cumulative ACKs, single retransmission timer. Retransmission is triggered by timeout events or duplicate ACKs. Usually a long delay before resending a lost packet. If there are duplicate ACKs, then the sender knows a segment was lost.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP timeout</span>
				<span class="description">Longer than RTT. If it’s too short, then unnecessary retransmissions will occur due to a premature timeout. If it’s too long, then there won’t be a quick enough reaction to segment losses. Estimated RTT is 1 take away a, where a is usually 0.125, multiplied by the estimated RTT added with a multiplied by the Sample RTT (measured time from segment transmission until ACK receipt). So (1 - a) * EstimatedRTT + a * SampleRTT. TimeoutInterval is Estimated RTT added with 4 multiplied by the Deviation RTT, which is the SampleRTT  deviation from the Estimated RTT. Deviation RTT is (1 - b) * DevRTT + B * SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT where b usually 0.25.</span>

			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP flow control</span>
				<span class="description">The receiver side of a TCP connection has a buffer. The buffer has a receiver window, which is the amount of free space the buffer has. The data comes from the IP, goes into the buffer, and then gets transmitted to the application process. The window is calculated by taking the total buffer, and taking away the addition of the last byte received, and the last byte read. The receiver tells the sender how much free space there is by including the receiver window (RcvWindow) in the segment. Sender limits its unACKed data to the receiver window size, so that the buffer doesn’t overflow.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP congestion control</span>
				<span class="description">Too many sources sending too much data too fast for the network to handle. Different from flow control. Causes lost packets (buffer overflow at routers), and long delays (queuing in router buffers). There are two approaches to congestion control; additive increase (increase congestion window by 1 maximum segment size every RTT until loss is detected), and multiplicative decrease (cut congestion window in half after loss). Sender limits transmission. </span>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP sending rate</span>
				<span class="description">Send congestion window bytes, wait RTT for ACKs, then send more bytes. So the rate is the congestion window divided by the RTT, and it’s measured in bytes per second.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<span class="title">TCP slow start</span>
				<span class="description">When a connection is established, increase the rate exponentially until a segment is lost. Initially, the congestion window would be 1 maximum segment size, which is then doubled every RTT, which is done by incrementing the congestion window for every ACK received. So the initial rate is slow, but ramps up exponentially fast. It’s an aggressive approach. There is a threshold, and on a timeout, it equals the congestion window divided by 2. When the congestion window is bigger than or equal to the threshold, then congestion avoidance kicks in and the congestion window grows linearly. This is a more conservative approach. </span>
